## Abilities
### Traits
- **Sand Camouflage:** The saolom has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy terrain.
  
- **Sand Burrow:** The saolom can burrow through sand at its full speed without making a sound. It cannot burrow through solid rock or similar hard surfaces.

### Actions
- **Slam:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach: target standing on the saolom. *Hit:* The target is lifted high into the air by the saolom's sudden upward motion. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 2d8 + 4 bludgeoning damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also restrained until the end of its next turn, unable to move due to the impact of the fall.
  
- **Swallow:** The saolom makes a grapple check against a Medium or smaller creature it has hit with its slam attack. If successful, the creature is grappled and restrained, and the saolom moves up to half its burrow speed underground. While swallowed, the creature takes 13 (2d8 + 4) acid damage at the start of each of the saolom's turns. If the saolom takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the saolom must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the saolom.
  
- **Sandstorm Blast (Recharge 5-6):** The saolom begins to vibrate its body intensely and starts to spin, causing sand to swirl around it and creating a sandstorm effect within a 30-foot radius centered on itself for one turn. Each creature in that area must make a DC (20 - distance in feet) Dexterity saving throw. On a fail, the creature is blinded and remains in the sandstorms area without orientation. On a success, the creature saves itself from the sandstorm and remains outside of the radius.

## Description
- **Appearance:** The Saolom appears as a massive, heavily armored creature, its body covered in rough, sand-colored scales that blend perfectly with desert environments.
- **Behavior:** Saoloms are solitary hunters, using their burrowing ability and sandstorm blast to ambush prey or defend their territory with lethal efficiency.
