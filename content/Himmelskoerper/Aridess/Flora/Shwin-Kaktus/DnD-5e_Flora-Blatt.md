### Traits
- **Spider-like Threads:** The Shwin-Kaktus produces thin, sticky threads that extend up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn within these threads or enters them for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become sensed by the cactus. The next action of this creature will trigger *Poisonous Stingers*. The threads can be destroyed (without triggering *Poisonous Stingers*) from the outside only by carefully cutting or burning them.

- **Poisonous Stingers:** The Shwin-Kaktus uses its reaction to launch its poisonous stingers at a creature that triggered its Spider-like Threads. The target must succeed on a DC 15+2X Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage due to the threads connected to it. On a failed save, the target takes 1 piercing damage, the poisoned condition, and additionally 1 poison damage every round until cured.

## Description
- **Appearance:** The Shwin-Kaktus resembles a small, spherical cactus covered in fine, glistening threads.
- **Behavior:** The Shwin-Kaktus remains stationary, relying on its Spider-like Threads to detect and ensnare prey. It uses its Poisonous Stingers defensively to deter threats.
